# Finding UI Nodes

Thank you for your time today! After the interview, I continued working on the programming problem from Coderpad. I created an App Playground in XCode in which the UI buttons represent nodes. And a group of buttons also is considered a node. 
The result was implemented as a recursive DFS. Please find a screenshot and video of my application below. Thank you!!
